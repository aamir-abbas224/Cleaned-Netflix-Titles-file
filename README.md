Netflix Dataset Analysis with Pandas
Description

This project demonstrates basic data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis using the Netflix dataset. It focuses on preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing text, fixing date formats, and sorting entries. The cleaned dataset is ready for further exploratory data analysis or visualization.

Key learning objectives:

Handling missing values (NaN) in text and numeric columns

Standardizing text with string operations (strip, title-case)

Converting and extracting information from date columns

Sorting and indexing data for analysis

Saving cleaned datasets for further use

Note: This project is primarily a learning exercise in Pandas. The original dataset is publicly available; the focus here is on practicing and understanding data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
